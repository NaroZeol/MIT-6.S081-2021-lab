Some race conditions may occur when using a list form hash table.
One sequence to cause a failure is as follows:
    1. Thread A calls put and go into insert.
    2. A context switch occurs before *p = e is executed.
    3. Thread B calls put and go into insert.
    4. Thread B goes into insert and sets *p = e.
    5. context switch to thread A and execute *p = e.

Suppose that p points to the same bucket in the hash table in both threads.
After thread B sets *p = e, then thread A sets *p = e.
Thread A overwrites the value that thread B set.
This cause a miss and memory leak.
